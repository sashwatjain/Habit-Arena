
# 🌟 Habit Arena — A Gamified Habit-Tracking Experience

**Habit Arena** is a personal project I am building to learn full-stack development while creating something I can use every day.
The goal is to turn self-improvement into a fun, game-like experience where completing real habits earns rewards, streaks, and progress on a global leaderboard.

> 🚧 **Project Status:** Active Development
> This project is currently a work-in-progress. I am adding features, improving the UI/UX, and refining the backend as I learn.
