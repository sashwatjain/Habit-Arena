✅ 1. What we have so far

You already built a working playable core loop:

Backend:

✔ Register users
✔ Add habits
✔ Complete habits (coins + streak)
✔ List all habits
✔ Leaderboard
✔ Database stores everything
✔ Fully working API

Frontend:

✔ Login page
✔ Dashboard
✔ Fetch & show all habits
✔ Add habit
✔ Complete habit
✔ UI auto-updates after actions

This is a real playable prototype.

🎮 2. What Features You Should Add NEXT (Roadmap)

Here is the best possible next steps in order of importance, based on game design, player experience, and app stability.

⭐ NEXT FEATURE 1 — Better Habit Display + Coins/Streak UI

Right now:

You complete habit → reward comes (alert message)

But the UI does not show total coins

No visual reward

No streak indicators (🔥 flames, 🔥 icons, etc.)

What we should add:

✔ Show total coins at top
✔ Show total streaks per habit visually
✔ Add streak flames animation
✔ Add coin animation when habit completed
✔ Make habit list look better

This improves player experience immediately.

⭐ NEXT FEATURE 2 — Negative Habits Support (Penalties)

Add bad habits behavior:

Completing a bad habit = penalty

Coins decrease

Streak breaks

Maybe unlock “punishment missions”

This makes Habit Arena more realistic.

⭐ NEXT FEATURE 3 — Daily Reset Logic

A real habit game must:

Reset daily status at midnight

Break streak if missed a day

Award “perfect day” bonus

This turns it into real habit building, not clicking.

⭐ NEXT FEATURE 4 — Leaderboard UI

Right now leaderboard is API-only.

We need:

✔ leaderboard.html
✔ sorted players by coins
✔ icons + ranks (gold, silver, bronze)
✔ real-time updates later

⭐ NEXT FEATURE 5 — Login System (Proper Auth)

Right now login is:

username only

instant registration

Eventually we need:

✔ JWT login
or
✔ Supabase Auth integration

But this can wait until later.

⭐ NEXT FEATURE 6 — Shop + Troops

Players can buy:

Troops

Skins

XP Boosters

Streak Protection

Special Items

This makes it feel like a game, not just habit tracker.

⭐ NEXT FEATURE 7 — Challenge Arena Multiplayer

This is where HABIT ARENA becomes special:

Create challenge (e.g., 7-day running)

Other players join

Real-time scoreboard

Winner gets trophies

This will be the hardest part — but also the most fun.
